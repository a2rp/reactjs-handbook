# ReactJS Handbook

Bite-sized, expandable React notes that I actually use day-to-day—each topic is a small toggleable component with clear text and copy-paste code.

## What is this?

-   A growing handbook of micro-topics (definition, Vite setup, JSX rules, state, effects, routing, performance, etc.).
-   Each topic is a single React component with a clickable title → expands/collapses the tutorial.
-   UI is built with styled-components using a shared Styled object.
-   Focused on local dev first, with simple GitHub Pages deploy when needed.
-   Topics (growing)
    -   React: definition & inspiration
    -   Vite install (create app, run dev)
    -   many more

## Quick start (local)

```bash
npm i
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```
